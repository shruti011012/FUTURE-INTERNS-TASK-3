# Task 3 – Crypto Meme / Poster

## Theory  
To engage people in crypto concepts, visual storytelling works best. I studied how memes and infographics capture attention and simplify ideas. Then I applied that to blockchain content — blending humor, clarity, and visual appeal.

## What I Did  
- Designed a cartoonish meme/infographic explaining blockchain steps.  
- Ensured it’s catchy yet educational.  
- Posted it on GitHub and LinkedIn to share with others.  

## Learnings & Reflection  
- I learned how to communicate technical ideas in a fun way.  
- The process taught me about audience engagement and visual simplicity.  
- This skill helps me turn complex blockchain content into digestible visuals.
